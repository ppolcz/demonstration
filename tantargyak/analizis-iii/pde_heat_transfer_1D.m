%% PDEX1  Example 1 for PDEPE
%   This is a simple example with an analytical solution that illustrates
%   the straightforward formulation, computation, and plotting of the solution
%   of a single PDE.
%
%   In the form expected by PDEPE, the single PDE is
%
%   [pi^2] .*  D_ [u] =  D_ [   Du/Dx   ] +      [0]
%              Dt        Dx
%    ----         ---       -------------    -------------
%     c            u        f(x,t,u,Du/Dx)   s(x,t,u,Du/Dx)
%
%   The equation is to hold on an interval 0 <= x <= 1 for times t >= 0.
%   There is an analytical solution u(x,t) = exp(-t)*sin(pi*x). Boundary
%   conditions are specified so that it will be the solution of the initial-
%   boundary value problem.  Obviously the initial values are sin(pi*x).
%   Two kinds of boundary conditions are chosen so as to show how they
%   appear in the form expected by the solver.  The left bc is u(0,t) = 0:
%
%     [u]    +     [0] .* [       Du/Dx          ] = [0]
%
%     ---          ---    ------------------------   ---
%   p(0,t,u)      q(0,t)        f(0,t,u,Du/Dx)        0
%
%   The right bc is taken to be pi*exp(-t) + Du/Dx(1,t) = 0:
%
%   [ pi*exp(-t) ] + [1] .* [   Du/Dx    ] = [0]
%
%   --------------   ---    --------------   ---
%      p(1,t,u)     q(1,t)   f(1,t,u,Du/Dx)   0
%
%   The problem is coded in subfunctions PDEX1PDE, PDEX1IC, and PDEX1BC.
