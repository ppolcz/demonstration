(* NCPolynomial *)
NCPolynomial::usage = "\
NCPolynomial[indep,rules,vars] is an expanded efficient representation for an nc polynomial in vars which can have commutative or noncommutative coefficients.

The nc expression indep collects all terms that are independent of the letters in vars.

The _Association_ rules stores terms in the following format:

    {mon1, ..., monN} -> {scalar, term1, ..., termN+1}

where:

-   mon1, ..., monN: are nc monomials in vars;
-   scalar: contains all commutative coefficients; and
-   term1, ..., termN+1: are nc expressions on letters other than the ones in vars which are typically the noncommutative coefficients of the polynomial.

vars is a list of _Symbols_.

For example the polynomial

    a**x**b - 2 x**y**c**x + a**c

in variables x and y is stored as:

    NCPolynomial[a**c, <|{x}->{{1,a,b}},{x**y,x}->{{2,1,c,1}}|>, {x,y}]

NCPolynomial specific functions are prefixed with NCP, e.g. NCPDegree.
