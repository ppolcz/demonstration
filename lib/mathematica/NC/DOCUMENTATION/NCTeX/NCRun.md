### NCRun {#NCRun}

`NCRun[command]` is a replacement for the built-in `Run` command that gives a
bit more control over the execution process.

`NCRun[command, options]` uses `options`.

The following `options` can be given:

- `Verbose` (`True`): print information on command being run;
- `CommandPrefix` (`""`): prefix to `command`;

See also: `Run`.
