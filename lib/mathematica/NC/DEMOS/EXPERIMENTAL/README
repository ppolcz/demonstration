If you're just starting with NCAlgebra, check out the following demos:

1. MostBasicCommands.nb
2. GoNCGB.nb

------

WHEN DEMOS FAIL:
  Many demos use our command NCProcess. It is easy to tell
  because you will see NCProcess directly in the input.

The trickiest software to get working is NCProcess.
That is because it uses Mma, LaTex, yap or adobe or preview and creates several files, often called Example.tex, etc. 

So if NCProcess doesnt work that is because it is 
is not finding one of these. It can be fixed by a good path detective.
