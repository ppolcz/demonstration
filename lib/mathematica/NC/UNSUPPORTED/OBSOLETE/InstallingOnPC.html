How to use NCAlgebra and NCGB on a PC
</h1>

<br> 

<h2>Download and Unzip NCAlgebra and NCGB</h2>

<ol>
<li> 
<b>Download</b> either Win.zip or NCAlg.zip from the web site 
<a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg</a>.
The rest of the instructions here will assume that you have
downloaded Win.zip.
</li><li> 
<b>Unzip</b> this file into the directory in which you want to 
install NCAlgebra. (If you do not know how to do this,
click <a href="PCUnzipInstructions.html">here</a>).
</li><li>
<b>You should now have a directory called NC</b>
which contains files and subdirectories.
</li>
</ol>

<a name="configurencalgebra">
<h2> Set Up Path To NCAlgebra</h2>
</a>

<ol>
<li>
If you have unzipped Win.zip in a directory which is in the Mathematica's
path (type <tt>$Path</tt> in Mathematica to determine this),
then you can skip the next steps and move to the section 
<a href="#RUNningncalgebra">Starting NCAlgebra</a>.
</li><li>
Now you need to set up your path to NCAlgebra so that 
the NC directory loads automatically. 
Choose <b>ONE</b> of the following options.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
<li>
If you are experienced with Mathematica,
you can edit your <tt>init.m</tt> file to add the name of the directory
which contains the NC folder to the Mathematica variable $Path.
</li></ol>
OR
<ol start="2"><li>
You can use our <tt>SetUpNCPath.nb</tt>
notebook to automagically set up the Mathematica's $Path variable.
Open this notebook and follow the directions which are found there.
</li></ol>
</ol>

<a name="runningncalgebra">
<h2> Starting NCAlgebra (Version 3.8 and higher)</h2>
</a>
<ol>
<li>
Start Mathematica and type
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NC`;   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(* This reads paths for NCAlgebra and NCGB
*)<br>
&lt;&lt;NCAlgebra`; 
(* This loads NCAlgebra 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*)
</code>
</blockquote>
If this does not work, then 
go back to 
<a href="#configurencalgebra">set up your path</a> for NCAlgebra. <br>
<font size=-1>
(Note: The ` character is a character which is often found
on the same key as the tilda (that is, ~) and is <b>not</b> the single quote character.)
</font>
There should be quite a few
statements saying that various files have loaded.

<h2> Starting NCAlgebra (<u>Before</u> Version 3.8)</h2>
</a>
<ol>
<li>One part of the documentation which is online gives additional detail
about how to install older versions of NCAlgebra in <b>unix</b>
(the approach is similar for the PC). Click
<a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/NCBIGDOC02/node439.html">
here
</a> to see that information.

<h2>Testing NCAlgebra</h2>
</a>
<ol>
<li>
To test the installation of NCAlgebra,
<a href="#runningncalgebra">start</a> NCAlgebra
and then type 
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NCTEST;</code>
</blockquote>
</li>

<a name="runningncgb">
<h2> Set Up Paths and Starting NCGB</h2>
</a>
<ol><li>
You do not need to read this section if you want to use NCAlgebra,
but do not want to use NCGB.
</li><li>
If you have set up paths for NCAlgebra, the paths for NCGB should be set up also.
To run NCGB, first start Mathematica and then type
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NC`;
&nbsp;
(* This reads paths for NCAlgebra and NCGB
*)<br>
&lt;&lt;NCGB`; 
(* This loads NCGB and NCAlgebra 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*)
</code>
</blockquote>

(Note:
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NC`;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(* This sets up NCAlgebra and NCGB *)<br>
&lt;&lt;NCAlgebra`; 
(* This loads NCAlgebra 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*)<br>
&lt;&lt;NCGB`; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(* This loads NCGB.

also works.)

<h2>Testing NCGB </h2>
</a>
<ol><li>
To test NCGB, first <a href="#runningncgb">start</a> NCGB and then
type <code>TimedGBTest[1,5]</code>. 
You should see quite a bit of stuff pass by on the screen. When
the TimedGBTest command is finished, you should see 
something which looks like:
<pre>
RESULTS::::
GBtest[1] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.191150 mmaM:8412880)
GBtest[2] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.097872 mmaM:8415880)
GBtest[3] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.095502 mmaM:8418592)
GBtest[4] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.094189 mmaM:8424272)
GBtest[5] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.117072 mmaM:8425760)
</pre>
Typing <code>TimedGBTest[1,20]</code> runs the first 20 tests.
</li></ol>

<h2>Running existing NCAlgebra and NCGB Demo Notebooks</h2>
The best demos to try are in the <tt>NC\work</tt> directory.
There are also many demos in the <tt>NC\NCAlgebra</tt> directory.
<font size=-1>
To find these demos:
<ol>
<li>
Find the directory 
<tt>NC\work</tt>, 
<tt>NC\NCAlgebra</tt>, 
<tt>NC\NCGB\MmaSource</tt> 
with Internet Explorer.
</li><li>
See what notebooks are provided.
Determine which files have a suffix of <tt>nb</tt>
and have <tt>Demo</tt> in their names.
</li></ol>
</font>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
If you would like to read some documentation and some more demonstrations, 
change directories into NC\DOCUMENTATION. 
This directory is filled with postscript and pdf
files which could be viewed if you have installed the 
appropriate software.
<br>
<font size=-1>
You can download the software from
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/</a>
to view postscript files in windows.
You can download the software from
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html</a>
to view pdf files in windows.
</font>
</li><li>
The main document is provided in three different forms.
DOCUMENT.pdf  and DOCUMENT.ps are in the NC\DOCUMENTATION
directory and can be printed (Note: It is over 350 pages long). 
There is also an HTML version of the document which can be obtained by 
clicking the "THE BIG DOCUMENT" link on the 
<a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/</a> web page or
via the download page (which can be accessed via the
<a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/</a>
web page).
This HTML and PDF versions of the document can be scanned
just like any other HTML or PDF document.
</li><li>
In each version of the document, both the table of contents and the 
index lists all NCAlgebra commands.
</li></ol>
