To get started the average user is best off reading the web
document:

          www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/DOWNLOAD/Starting.html

What it says is roughly:

To use NCAlgebra or  NCGB, change the file 
           SetNCDir.m 
appropriately to lead to your NC directory  (see the file SetNCDir.m) .
Always load SetNCDir.m before loading NCAlgbera.m or NCGB.m
Try this and if you have trouble you might have to read some more,
hopefully trouble will stay away.

The path setting is done automatically if you run the file
NCInstall.m inside of mathematica.  This automatically 
creates a correct SetNCDir.m unless you are unlucky in which
case you have to do by hand.

----------------

Starting.html is more clearly written than this file
which is primarily for UNIX users.
However, PC users can learn from this file. 
In fact a glance at this will explain the directory structure to
anyone.


   (a) (FOR THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR) 
         Modify the system wide init.m file so that 
         the value of $NCDir$ in SetNCDir.m is
         a member of the Mathematica command $Path.
         This is done by typing 

             AppendTo[$Path,"/home/ncalg/NC"];

         if it turned out that the value of $NCDir$ is
         "/home/ncalg/NC". The next task is to instruct the
         users what to do. The users should first create a 
         directory which they want to work in (using the
         mkdir command) and move into this directory
         (using the cd command). The user should then
         create a file called init.m which contains the 
         one line of text
  
             Get["SetNCDir.m"];
         
   (b) (FOR THOSE OTHER THAN THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR)
         Create the directory which you want to work in
         (using the mkdir command).  Move into this directory
         (using the cd command). In this directory,
         create a file called init.m which contains two lines
         of text. The first line of text in the init.m file
         will be based on the value which you assigned to $NCDir$.
         Suppose that the value of $NCDir$ is "/home/ncalg/NC".
         The file you create would then be

             AppendTo[$Path,"/home/ncalg/NC"];
             Get["SetNCDir.m"]; 
  
         If, on the other hand, the value of $NCDir$ was
         "/filesystem/theDirectory/NC", then the init.m file 
         which you create will contain the two lines

             AppendTo[$Path,"/filesystem/theDirectory/NC"];
             Get["SetNCDir.m"]; 
   (c) Move into the DOCUMENTATION directory by typing
       `cd DOCUMENTATION' and follow the instructions
       in the README file.
   (d) (Optional)
         To see that everything is working well, move into
         the directory set up in step (b) and start mathematica.
         You should see In[1] := 
         First type
             Get["NCAlgebra.m"]
         It will take about a minute before you get In[2] :=
         Now type 
             Get["NCTEST"]


To use NCAlgebra with NCGB, follow directions for (a), (b), (c) 
and (d) above and 

   (e) (For those other than the system administrator)
         Read and follow the directions in the file NCGB/README.

   (f) (Optional)
         To see that everything is working well, move into
         the directory set up in step (a). 
         Create a subdirectory called C++TestResults.
         Start mathematica.
         You should see In[1] :=
         First type
             Get["NCGB.m"]
         It will take about a minute before you get In[2] :=
         Now type
             TimedGBTest[1,20];
