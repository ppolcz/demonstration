class="cmbx-12">ReleaseNotes NCAlgebra 4.0 </span>January 2010
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Code has been cleaned up and improved. Basic functionality is supported without changes.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">ReleaseNotes NCAlgebra 3.7 </span>Sept. 2002
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Convexity   </span>We changed some defaults and fixed some bugs in NCConvexityRegion and
NCMatrixOfQuadratic. Now it runs quickly on fairly big problems.
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Path Setting   </span>Paths were set to make NCAlgebra more path independent.
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">CSP  </span>Our support for Control System Professional was updated to accomodate the second (2002)
version of CSP.
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">ReleaseNotes NCAlgebra 3.5 </span>Sept. 2001
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Basic Changes   </span>You no longer have to set every variable to be noncommutative. We have a
command NCGuts which has an option called NCSetNC. When set to True, all letters are
automatically noncommutative unless SetCommutative makes them commutative.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent">   A further option of NCGuts allows one to use &#8220;**&#8221; to multiply matrices with noncommutative
entries &#8211; the more cumbersome MatMult command is no longer needed. While this option seems
dangerous to Bill, it makes many computations prettier and easier to type. If you don&#8217;t trust the
answer, then don&#8217;t use the option.
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Commands For Matricies With Noncommuting Entries   </span>We now have an LDU
decomposition for matricies with noncommuting entries. Also, there is a command for computing
the inverse of such matrices (however this only works under strong assumptions).
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent">   NCMatrixOfQuadratic gives a vector matrix factorization of a symmetric quadratic
noncommutative function.
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">A Second Derivative Command   </span>NCHessian computes the Hessian of a function with
noncommuting variables and coefficents.
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Computing The Region Where A Noncommutative Function is Convex</span>
NCConvexityRegion is a command used to determine the region of formal noncommutative
inequalities where a given noncommutative function is convex.

class="description"><span 
class="cmtt-12">NCGuts: </span>NCGuts holds set of options geared for simplifying transposing, finding the inverse,
      and multiplying matrices conaining noncommuting variables.
      <!--l. 111--><p class="noindent">NCStrongProduct1 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-12">&gt; </span>False is the first option of NCGuts. When True, ** serves
      to multiply matrices with noncommutative entries as well as maintaining its original
      function. In addition, tp[ ] and tpMat are the same. The default setting is True.
      <!--l. 117--><p class="noindent">NCStrongProduct2 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-12">&gt; </span>False is the second option of NCGuts. When set to True, if
      <span 
class="cmmi-12">M </span>is a matrix with noncommutative entries, inv[M] returns a formula expression for
      the inverse of <span 
class="cmmi-12">M</span>. NCStrongProduct2 forces NCStrongProduct1.
      <!--l. 123--><p class="noindent">NCSetNC <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-12">&gt; </span>False is the last option of NCGuts. When set to True, all letters
      are automatically noncommutative unless SetCommutative makes them commutative.
      This replaces the need for repeated calls to SetNonCommutative.

      first element is the left border vector, the second element is a symmetric coefficent
      matrix, and the third is the right border vector. The border vectors contain the variables
      in the given quadratic function and their transposes.

      There are three possible types of outputs for each list. Two of them correspond to
      NCIndependenceCheck successfully determining whether or not the list of polynomials
      is independent. The third type of output corresponds to an unsuccessful attempt at
      determining dependence or independence.
