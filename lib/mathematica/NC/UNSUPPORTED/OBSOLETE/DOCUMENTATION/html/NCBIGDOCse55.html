<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent">The commands which we use to implement a prestrategy are called NCProcess1 and NCProcess2.
NCProcess1 and NCProcess2 are variants on a more general command called NCProcess. A person
can make use of NCProcess1 and NCProcess2 without knowing any of the NCProcess
options.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent">   The NCProcess commands are based upon a GBA and will be described in <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&#167;</span><a 
href="NCBIGDOCse50.html#x84-21200015.2">15.2<!--tex4ht:ref: section:ncprocess --></a>. GBA&#8217;s are
very effective at eliminating or solving for variables. A person can use this practical approach to
performing computations and proving theorems <span 
class="cmti-12">without knowing anything about </span>GBA&#8217;s. Indeed,
this chapter is a self-contained description of our method.
<!--l. 274--><p class="indent">   The <span 
class="cmbx-12">input </span>to NCProcess command one needs:
      <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I1. A list of knowns.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I2. A list of unknowns (together with an order which gives you priorities for eliminating
      them).
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I3. A collection of equations in these knowns and unknowns. <span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="NCBIGDOC93.html#fn1x61"><sup >1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x92-228001f1"></a>
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I4. A number of iterations.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 287--><p class="indent">   The knowns (I1) are set using the <span 
class="cmmi-12">SetKnowns </span>command, The unknowns (I2) are set using the
<span 
class="cmmi-12">SetUnknowns </span>command, For example, <span 
class="cmmi-12">SetKnowns</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">A,B,C</span>] sets <span 
class="cmmi-12">A</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-12">B </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-12">C </span>known and
<span 
class="cmmi-12">SetUnknowns</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">x,y,z</span>] sets <span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-12">y </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-12">z </span>unknown. Also, in this case, the algorithms sets the highest
prioirity on eliminating <span 
class="cmmi-12">z</span>, then <span 
class="cmmi-12">y </span>and then <span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span>. Some readers might recall this is exactly the
information needed as input to NCMakeGB.
<!--l. 298--><p class="indent">   The <span 
class="cmbx-12">output </span>of the NCProcess commands is a list of expressions which are <span 
class="cmbx-12">mathematically</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-12">equivalent to the equations which are input </span>(in step I3). That is, the output equations and
input equations have exactly the same set of solutions as the input equations. When using

NCProcess1, this equivelent list hopefully has solved for some unknowns. The output is presented
to the user as
      <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O1. Unknowns which have been solved for and equations which yield these unknowns.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O2. Equations involving no unknowns.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O3. Equations selected or created by the user. <span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="NCBIGDOC94.html#fn2x61"><sup >2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x92-228002f2"></a>
      For example, in the context of S1 below, one would want to select the equation <span 
class="cmmi-12">E</span><sub ><span 
class="cmr-8">17</span></sub>.
      There are also times during a strategy when one wants to introduce new variables and
      equations. This is illustrated in Chapter <a 
href="NCBIGDOCch14.html#x72-20400014">14<!--tex4ht:ref: chapter:ncprocess:example --></a>.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O4. Equations involving only one unknown.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O5. Equations involving only 2 unknowns. etc. </dd></dl>
<!--l. 339--><p class="indent">   We say that an equation which is in the output of an NCProcess command is <span 
class="cmti-12">digested </span>if it
occurs in items O1, O2 or O3 and is <span 
class="cmti-12">undigested </span>otherwise. Often, in practice, the digested
polynomial equations are those which are well understood.
