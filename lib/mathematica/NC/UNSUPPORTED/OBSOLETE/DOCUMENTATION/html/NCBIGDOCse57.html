<!--l. 463--><p class="noindent">We wish to stress that one does not need to <span 
class="cmti-12">know  </span>a theorem in order to <span 
class="cmti-12">discover </span>it using the
techniques in this paper. Any method which assumes that all of the hypotheses can be
stated algebraically and that all of the hypotheses are known at the beginning of the
computation will be of limited practical use. For example, since the Gröbner Basis algorithm
only discovers polynomial equations which are algebraically true and not those which
require analysis or topology, the use of this algorithm alone has a limited use. Insights
gained from analysis during a computer session could be added as (algebraic) hypotheses
while the session is in progress. Decisions can take a variety of forms and can involve
recognizing a Riccati equation, recognizing that a particular square matrix is onto and so
invertible, recognizing that a particular theorem now applies to the problem, etc. The user
would then have to record and justify these decisions independently of the computer run.

a strategy allows for human intervention, the intervention must follow certain rigid rules for the

process.
<!--l. 615--><p class="indent">   When one exits the above loop, one is presented with the question of how to finish off the proof
of the theorem. We shall call the steps required to go from a final spreadsheet to the actual
theorem the &#8220;end game.&#8221; We shall describe some &#8220;end game&#8221; technique in <span

<!--l. 641--><p class="noindent">We mentioned earlier that NCProcess uses the Gröbner Basis algorithm. This GBA is implemented
via the command NCMakeGB. If NCProcess consisted of a call to the GBA and the
formatted output (<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&#167;</span><a 
href="NCBIGDOCse50.html#x84-21200015.2">15.2<!--tex4ht:ref: section:ncprocess --></a>) alone, then NCProcess would not be a powerful enough tool to
generate solutions to engineering or math problems. This is because it would generate
too many equations. It is our hope that the equations which it generates contain all
of the equations essential to solution of whatever problem you are treating. For the
problems we have considered, this has been our experience. On the other hand, it contains
equations derived from these plus equations derived from those derived from these as well as
precursor equations which are no longer relevant. That is, a GB contains a few jewels
and lots of garbage. In technical language a GB is almost never a small basis for an
ideal and what a human seeks in discovering a theorem is a small basis for an ideal.
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="NCBIGDOC100.html#fn6x61"><sup >6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x98-233001f6"></a> Thus
we have algorithms and substantial software for finding small (or smallest) sets of equations
associated to a problem. The process of running GBA followed by an algorithm for finding small

sets of equations is what constitutes NCProcess.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">16.3.4   </span> <a 
 id="x98-23400016.3.4"></a>Summary of a Prestrategy</h4>
<!--l. 690--><p class="noindent">We have just given the basic ideas. As a prestrategy proceeds, more and more equations are
digested by the user and more and more unknowns become knowns. Thus we ultimately have two
classes of knowns: original knowns <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img 
src="cmsy10-c-4b.png" alt="K" class="10-120x-x-4b" /></span><sub ><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub> and user designated knowns <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img 
src="cmsy10-c-4b.png" alt="K" class="10-120x-x-4b" /></span><sub ><span 
class="cmmi-8">U</span></sub>. Often a theorem can be
produced directly from the output by taking as hypotheses the existence of knowns <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120"><img 
src="cmsy10-c-4b.png" alt="K" class="10-120x-x-4b" /></span><sub ><span 
class="cmmi-8">U</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&#x222A;<img 
src="cmsy10-c-4b.png" alt="K" class="10-120x-x-4b" /></span><sub ><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub> which
are solutions to the equations involving only knowns.
<!--l. 707--><p class="indent">   Assume that we have found these solutions. To prove the theorem, that is to construct solutions
to the original equations, we must solve the remaining equations. Fortunately, the digested
equations often are in a block triangular form which is amenable to backsolving. This is one of the
benefits of &#8220;digesting&#8221; the equations.
<!--l. 715--><p class="indent">   An example, makes all of this more clear.
