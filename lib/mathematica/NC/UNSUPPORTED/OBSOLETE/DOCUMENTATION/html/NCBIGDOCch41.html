<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent"><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">To what extent can we make our A, B, C, D linear systems and operator calculations easier with</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">computer assistance? The standard symbol manipulators Mathematica, Maple, and Macsyma do not do</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">noncommutative algebra intelligently, so it is hard to find out. Our group wrote a package NCAlgebra</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">which runs under Mathematica and which is a reasonable beginning.</span>
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent">   <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">We see this package as a competitor to the yellow pad. Once you get used to it this might be</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">considerably more effective for hand calculations of modest size. Like Mathematica the emphasis is on</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">interaction with the program and flexibility.</span>
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent">   <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">I now prefer it to a yellow pad for many types of calculation and can recommend it to anyone who is</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">good with Mathematica or alternatively is familiar with computers to the extent of doing a substantial</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">amount of word processing. Putting a graduate student with computer talent on NCAlgebra also might</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">work well. Our experience at UCSD is that students find it easy to learn. Indeed anyone can play with</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">our package effortlessly, but one would have to be cautious about committing to a long term</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">research project using NCAlgebra without being able to make additional commands on his</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">own.</span>
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent">   <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">SYStems is based on NCAlgebra, a collection of &#8221;functions&#8221; for Mathematica designed to facilitate</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">manipulation and reduction of noncommutative algebraic expressions. Specifically, it allows computer</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">calculation in an algebra with involution. Such computations are common in many areas but our</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">background is operator theory and engineering systems so we are aiming at research in these areas rather</span>
<span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">than at the complete treatments of the basics in these subjects.</span>

<span

<span
