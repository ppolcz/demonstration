<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent">The commands which we use heavily are called NCProcess1 and NCProcess2. NCProcess1
and NCProcess2 are variants on a more general command called NCProcess. A person
can make use of NCProcess1 and NCProcess2 without knowing any of the NCProcess
options.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent">   The NCProcess commands are based upon a GBA and will be described in <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&#167;</span><a 
href="NCBIGDOCse50.html#x84-21200015.2">15.2<!--tex4ht:ref: section:ncprocess --></a>. GBA&#8217;s are
very effective at eliminating or solving for variables. Also we have algorithms for removing
Redundant equations for the output which can be turned on and off as options. NCProcess2
removes them much more agressively than NCProcess1, but is much slower and it may remove an
equation you really like. Also we have algorithms for removing Redundant equations for the output
which can be turned on and off as options. A person can use this practical approach to
performing computations and proving theorems <span 
class="cmti-12">without knowing anything about </span>GBA&#8217;s or the
options.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent">   The <span 
class="cmbx-12">input </span>to NCProcess command one needs:

      <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I1. A list of knowns.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I2. A list of unknowns (together with an order which gives you priorities for eliminating
      them).
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I3. A collection of equations in these knowns and unknowns. <span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x68-201001f1"></a>
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">I4. A number of iterations.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent">   The knowns (I1) are set using the <span 
class="cmmi-12">SetKnowns </span>command, The unknowns (I2) are set using the
<span 
class="cmmi-12">SetUnknowns </span>command, For example, <span 
class="cmmi-12">SetKnowns</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">A,B,C</span>] sets <span 
class="cmmi-12">A</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-12">B </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-12">C </span>known and
<span 
class="cmmi-12">SetUnknowns</span>[<span 
class="cmmi-12">x,y,z</span>] sets <span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-12">y </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-12">z </span>unknown. Also, in this case, the algorithms sets the highest
prioirity on eliminating <span 
class="cmmi-12">z</span>, then <span 
class="cmmi-12">y </span>and then <span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span>. Some readers might recall this is exactly the
information needed as input to NCMakeGB.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent">   The <span 
class="cmbx-12">output </span>of the NCProcess commands is a list of expressions which are <span 
class="cmbx-12">mathematically</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-12">equivalent to the equations which are input </span>(in step I3). That is, the output equations and
input equations have exactly the same set of solutions as the input equations. When using
NCProcess1, this equivelent list hopefully has solved for some unknowns. The output is presented
to the user as
      <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O1. Unknowns which have been solved for and equations which yield these unknowns.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O2. Equations involving no unknowns.
      </dd><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">O3. Equations selected or created by the user. <span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="NCBIGDOC70.html#fn2x25"><sup >2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x68-201002f2"></a>
      For example, in the context of S1 below, one would want to select the equation <span 
class="cmmi-12">E</span><sub ><span 
class="cmr-8">17</span></sub>.
      There are also times during a strategy when one wants to introduce new variables and
      equations. This is illustrated in Chapter <a 
href="NCBIGDOCch14.html#x72-20400014">14<!--tex4ht:ref: chapter:ncprocess:example --></a>.

<!--l. 129--><p class="indent">   We say that an equation which is in the output of an NCProcess command is <span 
class="cmti-12">digested </span>if it
occurs in items O1, O2 or O3 and is <span 
class="cmti-12">undigested </span>otherwise. Often, in practice, the digested
polynomial equations are those which are well understood.

<!--l. 139--><p class="noindent">Often one makes a run of NCProcess1 gets some likable equations, puts them in to another run of
NCProcess.
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent">   The digested equations (those in items O1, O2 and O3) often contain the necessary conditions
of the desired theorem and the main flow of the proof of the converse. If the starting polynomial
equations follow as algebraic consequences of the digested equations, then we should stop. One
might run NCProcess2 at this point inorder to get few equations.
