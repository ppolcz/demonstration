<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Here we list commands which we started to develop but did not pursue to the point of thorough
testing. If we pursue them we may change their calling sequences, etc.
   <div  
class="centerline">                                                 <span 
class="cmbx-12">BlockPartition</span>                                           </div>
This probably does not work reliably.
   <div  
class="centerline">                           <span 
class="cmbx-12">NCEliminate[ExpressionsList,varsList,opts]</span>                        </div>
This crudely generalizes the Mma command Eliminate to the noncommuting case. You should have
set a monomial order before running it. If not, there is an option &#x00A0;&#x00A0; <span 
class="cmti-12">UseNewOrder </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&#x2192; </span><span 
class="cmti-12">False</span>
&#x00A0;&#x00A0;which tells NCEliminate to use its (stupid) default ordering.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">25.1   </span> <a

contain a primative version of NCGB but <span 
class="cmbx-12">all in Mma; no C++. </span>That was our first
version.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent">   Probably it still works but we have not tried it in a long time. It is slow, we remember that
much. Since there is no document, about the best chance you have at deciphering it is to cruise
thru the usage statements and function definitions.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">25.2   </span> <a 
 id="x55-34300025.2"></a> NCXWholeProcess[ polys, orderList, fileName, grobIters] </h3>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent">This <span 
class="cmti-12">very </span>experimental function makes repeated calls to NCProcess[ ], changing the order at each
iteration in an attempt to triangularize the set of relations, <span 
class="cmmi-12">polys</span>.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent">   Let us walk through the first iteration of NCXWholeProcess. It begins with the order,
<span

class="cmmi-12">grobIters</span>,<span

class="E">E</span>X</span></span>file,
<span 
class="cmmi-12">fileName</span>-1.tex.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent">   The output of NCProcess will (hopefully) have polynomials in one unknown. These unknowns
will then be regarded as &#8220;determined&#8221;. These determined unknowns are moved to the bottom of
the unknowns in the order.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent">   A polynomial of the form
   <center class="math-display" >
<img

known as a singleton. Determined unknowns associated with singletons are moved to the top of the

order and the other determined unknowns are moved to the bottom of the unknowns. That is, the
new order is of the form
   <center class="math-display" >

<!--l. 69--><p class="indent">   We have finished the first iteration of NCXWholeProcess. The second iteration goes as
follows.

class="cmmi-12">fileName</span>-2.tex. Here <span 
class="cmmi-12">determinedPolys</span>
are all polynomials in 0 or 1 unknowns and <span 
class="cmmi-12">polys </span>denotes the same set of polynomials that we
input in the first iteration. The process is continued, changing the order and calling NCProcess
repeatedly.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent">   If no relations in one unknown are discovered at some iteration the currently unknown
indeterminates are cyclically permuted. If all cyclic permutations fail to produce any new relations
in one unknown the function NCXWholeProcess terminates stating that the problem was not
solved. Alternatively, if all unknown variables become determined the function NCXWholeProcess
terminates stating that the problem has been solved.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent">   This function is in a very primitive stage and the particulars of it will likely change.
