<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">NCAlgebra is a package which runs under Mathematica. It is an algebra program designed to
facilitate manipulation and reduction of noncommutative algebraic expressions. Specifically, it
allows computer calculation in an ALGEBRA WITH TRANSPOSES OR ADJOINTS. Such
computations are common in many areas but our background is operator theory and engineering
systems so we are aiming at applications in these areas rather than at the theory of symbolic
computation.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent">   A noncommutative Gröbner basis package is also available which is C++ linked to NCAlgebra.
At the moment we trust it under the Solaris, Linux, Mac OSX. Someday we hope to support
Microsoft Windows.
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent">   We have added files which allow one to use some of the functionality of the Mathematica
package Control System Professional with noncommuting indeterminates.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent">   Also included is a package for doing differentiation with complex variables. This package
manipulates expressions in terms of the variable <span 
class="cmmi-12">z </span>and <img 
src="NCBIGDOC0x.png" alt="&#x02C9;z"  class="bar" > rather than by using real and imaginary
parts.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent">   We are including a collection of files for doing system engineering. These are focused
specifically on computations which occur in doing <span 
class="cmmi-12">H</span><sup ><span 
class="cmsy-8">&#x221E;</span></sup> control research. Our intent is not to
produce a symbolic introduction to system theory but to focus on special areas of our
own research with the hope that others will write more general systems packages. The
interested user should read SYSDOC.dvi which is included and see the appendix on running
SYSTEMS.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent">   We see this package as a competitor to the yellow pad. Once you get used to it this might be
considerably more effective for some types of hand calculations. Like Mathematica the emphasis is
on interaction with the program and flexibility (see the section on Editing in the Helpful Tricks
chapter (Chapter <a 
href="NCBIGDOCch3.html#x7-150003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: helpful-tricks --></a>)).
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent">   NCAlgebra uses a slight modification of the Mathematica operation NonCommutativeMultiply
(denoted by **). Many of the NCAlgebra functions are noncommutative versions of
Mathematica functions used for simplification of commutative algebraic expressions.
For example, the functions NCExpand and NCCollect extend the utility of the usual
Mathematica functions Expand and Collect to algebraic expressions including noncommutative
multiplications. NCExpand expands complicated (multi-parentheses) expressions and thus
facilitates additive cancellation of terms. NCCollect does the opposite&#8211; it collects like terms.
In addition, a number of more specialized functions are designed to assist in solving
particular types of algebraic problems. These currently include capabilities for block matrix

manipulation, multi-dimensional differentiation, and specialized applications in systems
theory.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent">   In Chapter 1 we present a few simple examples. These actually contain more than you need to
know to have a good time with NCAlgebra. Once you have read about two pages you are already
WELL INTO NCAlgebra.
