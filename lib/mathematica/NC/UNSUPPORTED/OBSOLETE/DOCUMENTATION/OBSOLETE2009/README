This directory should contain 1 or more "dvi" (device independent) 
or "ps" (postscript) files
and some notebooks which can be executed as demos
or simply read.
These can be printed out
on a laser printer. For example, type

lpr NCDOCUMENT.ps

to printout the NCDOCUMENT.ps. 

The "dvi" version and the "ps" versions are the same --
they are just in different file formats.
  
  If you interested in NCAlgebra, but not NCGB, then
printout  NCDOCUMENT.dvi or NCDOCUMENT.ps,
but not any part of NCGBDOCUMENT.dvi or NCGBDOCUMENT.ps.

  If you interested in both NCAlgebra and NCGB, then
printout NCDOCUMENT.dvi or NCDOCUMENT.ps
and print out NCGBDOCUMENT.dvi or NCGBDOCUMENT.ps.



WHAT TO DO NEXT:
   Go up to the NC/ directory by typing

cd ../

form there you can run the package by following the document.
The basic idea is
Enter Mma, 
Load SetNCPath.m, (you have to edit it if you are running outside 
                   the NC directory)  
Load NCAlgebra.m,
open NCPalette.nb, go to the  Demo submenu of the main menu
which opens up,


------------------------------------------------

SOME OF THE DEMOS=  

In this directory they are postscript files.
These can be read (ghostview)  or printed out, but not executed.
The executable notebooks are in the NCAlgeba and NCGB directory.
They can be run from Demo menu in NCPalette.nb.

NCALGEBRA


DemoSimplify.ps - Demonstrates basic NCAlgebra commands
                  in the context of making a complicated 
                  expression simpler. More economical
                  simplification is achieved with NCGB software.


DemoBRL.ps    - Demonstrates basic NCAlgebra application to
             optimizing noncommutative Hamiltonians
             and there by proves the famous Bounded Real Lemma.

NCGB  YOU NEED OUR C++ coding to USE THIS --NOT ON MATH SOURCE


DemoGB1.ps - Gives a gentle intro example for NCGB.
DemoGB1A.ps - is the answer ( TeXed) which is generated.





DemoGBM.ps - Demonstates eliminating unknowns from systems of equations.
                via  Groebner basises. This can be used to present
                NCommutative Groebner Bases. 
DemoGBMA.ps - is the answer ( TeXed) which is generated.



DmGBG1.ps - An example in group theory. It shows a particular
            word in a group is actually the identity.
            It demonstrates NCSimplifyAll[ , , ].


DmGBG2.ps - An example in group theory. It selects two groups
            and shows they are equal.

DmGBG2A1.ps , DmGBG1A2.ps - are the answers ( TeXed) which are generated.
