Problems with LaTeX with a PC
</h1>

<ol><li>
LaTeX is not needed to run NCAlgebra and is not needed to run most of NCGB.
</li><li>
The problem faced with NCGB using LaTeX is almost always
with NCGB finding it automatically.
</li><li>
If you do not have LaTeX installed properly on your PC,  
then talk to your system administrator or
obtain a distribution of LaTeX for the PC
from the internet. 
<a href="http://www.miktex.org/">MikTeX (http://www.miktex.org/)</a> 
is a good choice.
</li><li>
You possibly have to 
modify the file <tt>NCGBTeXSetUp.m</tt> 
in the  <tt>NC/NCGB/MmaSource/</tt> directory.
Look at the file to see what to do.
