How to use NCAlgebra and NCGB on a Unix

<h2>Download and Unzip NCAlgebra and NCGB</h2>

<ol>
<li> 
<b>Download</b> a copy of the code from the web site 
<a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg</a>.
</li><li> 
<b>Uncompress</b> this file into the directory in which you want to 
install NCAlgebra. (If you do not know how to do this,
click <a href="UnixUncompressInstructions.html">here</a>).
</li><li>
<b>You should now have a directory called NC</b>
which contains files and subdirectories.
</li>
</ol>

<h2> Set Up Path To NCAlgebra</h2>
</a>

<ol>
<li>
If you have uncompressed a copy of the code into a directory 
which is in the Mathematica's
path (type <tt>$Path</tt> in Mathematica to determine this),
Then you can skip the next steps and move to the section 
<a href="#runningncalgebra">Starting NCAlgebra</a>.
</li><li>
Now you need to set up your path to NCAlgebra so that 
the NC directory loads automatically. 
Choose <b>ONE</b> of the following options.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1"> <li>
If you are experienced with Mathematica,
you can edit your <tt>init.m</tt> file to add the name of the directory
which contains the NC folder to the Mathematica variable $Path.
</li></ol>
OR
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="2"> <li>
You can use our <tt>SetUpNCPath.nb</tt>
notebook to automagically set up the Mathematica's $Path variable.
Open this notebook and follow the directions which are found there.
</li></ol>
</ol>

<a name="runningncalgebra">
<h2> Starting NCAlgebra (Version 3.8 and higher)</h2>
</a>
<ol>
<li>
Start Mathematica and type
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NC`;   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(* This reads paths for NCAlgebra and NCGB *)<br>
&lt;&lt;NCAlgebra`; 
(* This loads NCAlgebra 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*)
</code>
</blockquote>
If this does not work, then 
go back to 
<a href="#configurencalgebra">set up your path</a> for NCAlgebra. <br>
<font size=-1>
(Note: The ` character is a character which is often found
on the same key as the tilda (that is, ~) and is <b>not</b> the single quote character.)
</font>
There should be quite a few
statements saying that various files have loaded.

<h2> Starting NCAlgebra (<u>Before</u> Version 3.8)</h2>
</a>
<ol>
<li>One part of the documentation which is online gives additional detail
about how to install older versions of NCAlgebra.

<h2>Testing NCAlgebra</h2>
</a>
<ol>
<li>
To test the installation of NCAlgebra,
<a href="#runningncalgebra">start</a> NCAlgebra
and then type 
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NCTEST;</code>
</blockquote>

<h2> Set up Paths and Starting NCGB</h2>
</a>
<ol><li>
You do not need to read this section if you want to use NCAlgebra,
but do not want to use NCGB.
</li><li>
If you have set up the paths for NCAlgebra, then the paths for NCGB should also be set up.
To run NCGB, first start Mathematica and then type
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NC`;
&nbsp;
(* This reads paths for NCAlgebra and NCGB *)<br>
&lt;&lt;NCGB`; 
(* This loads NCGB and NCAlgebra 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*)
</code>
</blockquote>

<font size=-1>
(Note:
<blockquote>
<code>&lt;&lt;NC`;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(* This reads paths for NCAlgebra and NCGB 
*)<br>
&lt;&lt;NCAlgebra`; 
(* This loads NCAlgebra 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&lt;&lt;NCGB`;

<h2>Testing NCGB </h2>
</a>
<ol><li>
To test NCGB, first <a href="#runningncgb">start</a> NCGB and then
type <code>TimedGBTest[1,5]</code>. 
You should see quite a bit of stuff pass by on the screen. When
the TimedGBTest command is finished, you should see 
something which looks like:
<pre>
RESULTS::::
GBtest[1] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.191150 mmaM:8412880)
GBtest[2] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.097872 mmaM:8415880)
GBtest[3] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.095502 mmaM:8418592)
GBtest[4] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.094189 mmaM:8424272)
GBtest[5] = True  (oldtime=?? newtime=0:00:00.117072 mmaM:8425760)
</pre>
Typing <code>TimedGBTest[1,20]</code> runs the first 20 tests.
</li></ol>

<h2>Running existing NCAlgebra and NCGB Demo Notebooks</h2>
The best demos to try are in the <tt>NC/work</tt> directory.
There are also many demos in the <tt>NC/NCAlgebra</tt> directory,
<font size=-1>
To find these demos:
<ol>
<li>
Find the directory 
<tt>NC/work</tt>, 
<tt>NC/NCAlgebra</tt>, 
<tt>NC/NCGB/MmaSource</tt> 
either using the <tt>cd</tt> command on the command line
or through some graphical interface.
</li><li>
See what notebooks are provided.
Determine which files have a suffix of <tt>nb</tt>
and have <tt>Demo</tt> in their names.
If you are using the command line, then you may type
<tt>ls *Demo*.nb</tt> to determine this list of files.
</li></ol>
</font>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
If you would like to read some documentation and some more demonstrations, 
change directories into NC/DOCUMENTATION. 
This directory is filled with postscript and pdf
files which could be viewed if you have installed the 
appropriate software.
(The program <tt>ghostview</tt> can be used to view postscript files
and the program <tt>xpdf</tt> can be used to view pdf files. 
Both of these programs are often installed on Unix systems.)
</li><li>
The main document is provided in three different forms.
DOCUMENT.pdf  and DOCUMENT.ps are in the NC/DOCUMENTATION
directory and can be printed (Note: It is over 350 pages long). 
There is also an HTML version of the document which can be obtained by 
clicking the "THE BIG DOCUMENT" link on the 
<a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/</a> web page or
via the download page (which can be accessed via the
<a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/">http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/</a>
web page).
The HTML and PDF versions of the document can be scanned
just like any other HTML or PDF document.
</li><li>
In each version of the document, both the table of contents and the 
index lists all NCAlgebra commands.
</li></ol>
