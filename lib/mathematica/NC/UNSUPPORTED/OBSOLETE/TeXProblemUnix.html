Problems with LaTeX under Unix
</h1>

<ol><li>
LaTeX is not needed to run NCAlgebra and is not needed to run most of NCGB.
</li><li>
The problem faced with NCGB using LaTeX is almost always
with NCGB finding it automatically.
</li><li>
If you have LaTeX installed properly on your unix machine, then the command
<code> which latex</code> and <code>which xdvi</code> should both
return paths to the place where these commands are stored.
If either of them does not, ask your system administrator
to install them. 
</li><li>
You might have to
modify the file <tt>NCGBTeXSetUp.m</tt>
in the  <tt>NC/NCGB/MmaSource/</tt> director
if your latex or xdvi program
has strange names (or if you are using alternative programs).
Look at the file to see what to do.
