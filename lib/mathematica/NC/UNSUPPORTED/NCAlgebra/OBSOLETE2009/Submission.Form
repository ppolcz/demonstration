INSTRUCTIONS
============

This file is the MathSource Submission Form.  You may submit new
material for publication in MathSource by sending it through either
electronic or postal mail.

In order to provide a correct and complete listing for your material
in the MathSource directory, please complete the required items in
this file.  To help you distinguish those sections which require
you to supply information from those example and instructional
sections, the character string

	>>>  fill-in  <<<

is provided above those sections which require input on your part.
Then send all files comprising your submission (including
this Submission Form) to MathSource as described in the sections
labeled Email and Postal Mail below

Email
-----

Electronic mail is the preferred means of submission.  The MathSource
email address for submissions is
	
	ms-submit@wri.com

All files in your submission, including this Notebook, must be sent
as separate messages to this address.  The subject lines of the
messages comprising your submission should be identical to the
filenames you provide on this form.  (See the example below for
more details.)

	Example:  A submission entitled "Finite Automata Package"
	might include the files FiniteAutomata.m, FA-Notebook.ma,
	and Documentation.ps.  When submitting this material to
	MathSource the subject lines should read:

	contents of message		subject line
	-------------------		------------
	Submission Form			submission form
	FiniteAutomata.m		FiniteAutomata.m
	FA-Notebook.ma			FA-Notebook.ma
	Documentation.ps		Documentation.ps


When your material is received by MathSource, a message acknowledging
receipt will be sent to you via email.  Typically, your material will
be published within 2-3 days after it is received.


Postal Mail
-----------

Due to the electronic nature of MathSource, we encourage all
submissions be via electronic mail.  However, disks and tapes sent
by conventional courier are also acceptable.  Load all files
comprising your submission and the completed Submission Form (this
file) onto any media on which Mathematica is distributed. Label
each disk or tape with your name, address, and submission title
and send all materials to:

ABSTRACT OF SOFTWARE 
====================

Provide a brief summary of the purpose and content of your software
(about 100 words or less, please):

>>>  fill-in  <<<

Although processing of commutative expressions is built 
into Mathematica, relatively no support is given to 
noncommutative expression manipulation. These packages
have been developed to fill this void. 
Commands for non-commuting algebra which are analogous to 
Mathematica commands are implemented, as well as others. 
The  development of these packages has been directed by needs 
which arose from research in Control Theory Systems Theory and 
in Operator Theory.   Also attached to the NCAlgebra package
are files SYS* for doing calculations with engineering systems 
which are common in Hinfinity control and in differential games.
