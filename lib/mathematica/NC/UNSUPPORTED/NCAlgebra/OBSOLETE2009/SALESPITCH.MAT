   A SYMBOL MANIPULATOR FOR DEALING WITH NONCOMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA

 Noncommutative algebra is a corner stone of matrix thoery.     
The standard symbol manipulators Mathematica, Maple, and Macsyma 
do not do noncommutative algebra intelligently. Our group wrote a 
package NCAlgebra which runs under Mathematica and which is a 
reasonable beginning.

     We see this package as a competitor to the yellow pad.  Once you 
get used to it this might be considerably more effective for hand
calculations of modest size.  Like Mathematica the emphasis is on
interaction with the program and flexibility.  

    I now prefer it to a yellow pad and can recommend it to anyone who 
is good with Mathematica or alternatively is familiar with computers 
to the extent of doing a substantial amount of word processing.  
Putting a graduate student with computer talent on NCAlgebra also 
might work well.  Our experience at UCSD is that students find it 
easy to learn.  Indeed anyone can play with our package effortlessly, 
but one would have to be cautious about committing to a long term 
research project using NCAlgebra without being able to make 
additional commands on his own.

      NCAlgebra is a collection of "functions" for Mathematica 
designed to facilitate manipulation and reduction of noncommutative 
algebraic expr theory but in operator theory and engineering systems.

     NCAlgebra uses a slight modification of the Mathematica operation 
NonCommutativeMultiply (denoted by **).  Many of the NCAlgebra 
functions are noncommutative versions of Mathematica functions used 
for manipulation of commutative algebraic expressions.  For example, 
the functions NCExpand, and NCCollect extend the utility of the usual 
Mathematica functions Expand and Collect to algebraic expressions 
including noncommutative multiplications.  NCExpand expands 
complicated (multi-parentheses) expressions and thus facilitates 
additive cancellation of terms.  NCCollect does the opposite-- it 
collects like terms.  In addition, a number of more specialized 
functions are designed to assist in solving particular types of 
algebraic problems.  These currently include capabilities for block 
matrix manipulation and differentiation of expressions with respect to a 
noncommuting variable. 

      SYSTEMS is a collection of files which runs under NCAlgebra 
which is being developed by Mike Walker and Bill Helton.  It is in 
a primitive form with its main contents being a file for doing 
Hinfinity control for linear and certain nonlinear systems.  This 
actually amounts to a paper (Aug91; by Ball, Helton and Walker) which 
solves a collection of nonlinear Hinfinity control problems.  The formulas 
in the paper are executable inside NCAlgebra which greatly facilitates 
further research along these lines.

   The software is available by anonymous ftp from ncalg@osiris.ucsd.edu
or from the Mathematica bulletin board MathSource@wri.com (type help intro
for general help and find 0204-400 for NCAlgebra info).
